# Device Identification via Adaptive Periodic Traffic Fingerprints

This repository contains the artifact for our ACSAC 2025 paper:  
**"A Period-Adaptive Traffic Fingerprint-Based Method for Smart Home Device Identification"**  

The method segments IoT device traffic according to the periodicity of communication sessions, extracts key packet fingerprints, and applies a hierarchical matching mechanism to identify device types. It is designed to enable **real-time smart home device monitoring** and achieves **98.82% accuracy** on public datasets.

## Environment Setup

This artifact runs on **Linux (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04)** or **Google Colab** with **Python 3.8+**.

To install dependencies:

```
cd deviceIdentification
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

- Dependencies include:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - tqdm
  - scapy
  - pyshark
  - scipy
  - seaborn
  - openpyxl


Note: Executable Permissions
----------------------
Some scripts require execution permission before running. If you encounter
"Permission denied" when executing a script, please grant permission using:

    cd deviceIdentification
    chmod +x install.sh
    chmod +x artifact/run_demo.sh
    chmod +x claims/claim1/run.sh

## Running the Demo:

Run the full pipeline on the provided sample PCAP:

```
chmod +x artifact/run_demo.sh
./artifact/run_demo.sh
```

The pipeline will:

1. Segment traffic into sessions (PeriodProcess)
2. Extract features and cluster packets (preProcess)
3. Generate device fingerprints (SignatureGeneration)
4. Merge signatures into a library (signatureMatching)

Outputs are written to `artifact/outputs/`.
 If cached results exist in `artifact/data/cached/`, they will be reused to shorten runtime.

## Reproducing Claims

Reproducibility claims are located in the `claims/` directory.

For example, to reproduce **Claim 1** (accuracy â‰¥ 0.97 on demo data):

```
chmod +x claims/claim1/run.sh
./claims/claim1/run.sh
```

Expected validation files are under `claims/claim1/expected/`.
